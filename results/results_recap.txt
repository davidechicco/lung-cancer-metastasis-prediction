== Including "Stage" ==

* linear regression:
MCC = +0.87

* support vector machine (with optimized C=0.01)
MCC = +0.81

* k-nearest neighbors (with optimized k=19)
MCC = +0.76

* deep perceptron neural network (with optimized numbers of hidden units and hidden layers)
MCC = +1.0

I ran a random forest algorithm (random_forest.r) and noticed that Stage is a very important feature.
I also ran some scripts (correlation.r) which computed the Pearson, Spearman, Kendall correlations and confirmed the relation.

The dataset's main paper also explains that the Stage is strictly correlated with the Metastasis (Table 2 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0184370.t002 ).
"Stage 4" = "Metastasis M1 = 1 = tumor spread to distant organs"



== Excluding "Stage" ==

* linear regression:
MCC = +0.66

* k-nearest neighbors (with optimized k=8)
MCC = +0.67

* support vector machine (with optimized C=0.01)
MCC = +0.60
